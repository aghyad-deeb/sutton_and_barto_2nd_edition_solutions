## 3.1
1. Consider an agent trying to manage a company. The reward could be the stock
options value. The state could be the budget for each part of the company. The
actions could be increasing or decreasing the budget for each sector (a vector
of the change in each sector's budget).
2. Consider an agent representing a person trying to quit smoking. The reward
could be time since last smoked. The state could be the last couple of thoughts
(say 5) the person had, which the person does not have complete control over.
The action could be one active thought that the person can think of.
3. The agent can represent a person deciding whether to vote red or blue in the
next election. The reward is how satisfied they are with the policies being
issued. The state is the result of the election (since it's out of the control
of the agnet) and the policies.
