# Chapter 2 solutions
## 2.1 
If we explore we pick greedy arm with probability half and if we exploit we pick
it for sure.
$1/2 * 1 + 1/2 * 1/2 = 3/4$

## 2.2
Could be exploration: $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5$
(all actions could be exploration)
Must be exploration (picked suboptimal arm): $A_4, A_5$

## 2.3
